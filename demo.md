  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election": "Following polling inaccuracies in connection with the 2020 presidential election, pollsters took steps to avoid similar errors in 2024.[\\[466\\]][1][\\[467\\]][2] Despite these efforts, national polls underestimated Trump's support once again in 2024.[\\[468\\]][3] In 2016, national polls were fairly accurate; however, Trump overperformed the polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, leading to his Electoral College victory. In 2020, polls had overestimated Biden's margin over Trump by approximately 4% in competitive states.[\\[469\\]][4] In 2024, pollsters underestimated Trump's support by smaller margins than they did in 2016 and 2020,[\\[470\\]][5] and their underestimation of that support was within the realm of a [normal polling error][6].[\\[471\\]][7][\\[472\\]][8] Going into the election, most polls showed the race to be neck and neck and within the margin of error.[\\[473\\]][9] In every swing state, Trump outperformed his final polling numbers by approximately 3%, which is in line with a typical margin of error.[\\[474\\]][10] Compared with the 2020 polls, the margin of error in 2024 in swing states was lower and high-quality national polls were more accurate.[\\[472\\]][11]\n\nOn October 30, 2024, an 18-year-old man in [Jacksonville, Florida][12], was arrested for [aggravated assault][13] and [improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon][14] after brandishing a machete at two women outside an early voting center. He, along with seven other teenagers, allegedly approached and antagonized members of the opposing political party as they were demonstrating. Neither the teenager's nor the women's political parties were disclosed, although later posts by the Duval Democratic Party described the teenager's party as a \"group of young men carrying Trump flags\".[\\[447\\]][15] On November 1, 2024, a voter wearing a \"[Let's Go Brandon][16]\" hat was reportedly struck by a poll worker after a verbal altercation over his hat at an [Orangeburg County, South Carolina][17], polling location.[\\[448\\]][18] Also on November 1, a man in [Bath, New York][19], was arrested for assaulting someone in a supermarket for wearing a Trump hat.[\\[449\\]][20]\n\nIn late October 2024, multiple fires were reported at ballot drop boxes in [Portland, Oregon][21], and [Vancouver, Washington][22]. The fires damaged hundreds of ballots, requiring election officials to identify and offer new ballots to those affected by the fires. Prior to the fires, the [Federal Bureau of Investigation][23] and the [Department of Homeland Security][24] had issued a bulletin raising concerns that \"election-related grievances\" could motivate domestic extremist activity and that ballot drop boxes could potentially be \"attractive targets\".[\\[450\\]][25][\\[451\\]][26] In [Phoenix, Arizona][27], a fire was started in a mail collection box, destroying some ballots and other mail. A suspect was arrested and claimed that the fire was unrelated to the election.[\\[452\\]][28]\n\nSince the 2020 election and continuing into the 2024 election, the [election denial movement][29] prompted thousands of [death threats][30] directed at election workers, officials, and their families, with some receiving letters laced with [fentanyl][31].[\\[441\\]][32][\\[442\\]][33] As of March 2024, the [Department of Justice's][34] Election Threats Task Force had charged 20 people with threat-related crimes.[\\[443\\]][35] In September 2024, suspicious packages were sent to state election officials in several states, which resulted in evacuations. The inclusion of white powder in most of the packages mirrored the [2001 anthrax attacks][36]; the substance in Oklahoma packages was identified as flour.[\\[444\\]][37] Threats led some election workers to resign, and affected recruitment of temporary [poll workers][38].[\\[445\\]][39][\\[446\\]][40] In locations where funds were available,[\\[446\\]][41] efforts to protect election workers involved [active shooter training][42], provision of [first aid kits][43] and [Narcan][44], [bulletproof vests][45], [bulletproof glass][46], [metal detectors][47], armed guards, [police snipers][48], and [drones][49].[\\[445\\]][50]\n\nBelow is a list of states considered by one or more forecast to be competitive; states that are deemed to be \"safe\" or \"solid\" by forecasters _[The Cook Political Report][51]_, _[Sabato's Crystal Ball][52]_, _[Inside Elections][53]_, _[CNalysis][54]_, _[Decision Desk HQ][55]_, and [YouGov][56] are omitted for brevity.[\\[b\\]][57]\n\n[1]: #cite_note-470\n[2]: #cite_note-471\n[3]: #cite_note-472\n[4]: #cite_note-473\n[5]: #cite_note-474\n[6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_polling_error \"Normal polling error\"\n[7]: #cite_note-Morris_2024-475\n[8]: #cite_note-Warren_2024-476\n[9]: #cite_note-477\n[10]: #cite_note-478\n[11]: #cite_note-Warren_2024-476\n[12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida \"Jacksonville, Florida\"\n[13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggravated_assault \"Aggravated assault\"\n[14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_exhibition_of_a_dangerous_weapon \"Improper exhibition of a dangerous weapon\"\n[15]: #cite_note-448\n[16]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Go_Brandon \"Let's Go Brandon\"\n[17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeburg_County,_South_Carolina \"Orangeburg County, South Carolina\"\n[18]: #cite_note-449\n[19]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_New_York \"Bath, New York\"\n[20]: #cite_note-450\n[21]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon \"Portland, Oregon\"\n[22]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington \"Vancouver, Washington\"\n[23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\"\n[24]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security \"Department of Homeland Security\"\n[25]: #cite_note-451\n[26]: #cite_note-452\n[27]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona \"Phoenix, Arizona\"\n[28]: #cite_note-453\n[29]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_denial_movement_in_the_United_States \"Election denial movement in the United States\"\n[30]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat \"Death threat\"\n[31]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl \"Fentanyl\"\n[32]: #cite_note-442\n[33]: #cite_note-443\n[34]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice \"United States Department of Justice\"\n[35]: #cite_note-444\n[36]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks \"2001 anthrax attacks\"\n[37]: #cite_note-445\n[38]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poll_workers \"Poll workers\"\n[39]: #cite_note-VD-446\n[40]: #cite_note-HT-447\n[41]: #cite_note-HT-447\n[42]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_shooter_training \"Active shooter training\"\n[43]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit \"First aid kit\"\n[44]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcan \"Narcan\"\n[45]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_vest \"Bulletproof vest\"\n[46]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_glass \"Bulletproof glass\"\n[47]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector \"Metal detector\"\n[48]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_sniper \"Police sniper\"\n[49]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle \"Unmanned aerial vehicle\"\n[50]: #cite_note-VD-446\n[51]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report \"The Cook Political Report\"\n[52]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabato%27s_Crystal_Ball \"Sabato's Crystal Ball\"\n[53]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Elections \"Inside Elections\"\n[54]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNalysis \"CNalysis\"\n[55]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ \"Decision Desk HQ\"\n[56]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov \"YouGov\"\n[57]: #cite_note-456",
