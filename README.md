# What this Does?

We've developed a web application using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend that leverages a large language model (LLM) to help users find the best laptop based on their specific preferences. By simply describing their needs—such as budget, usage (e.g., gaming, programming, content creation), portability, and performance—the LLM intelligently processes the input and suggests the most suitable laptops. The system combines natural language understanding with real-time data handling to deliver accurate, user-focused recommendations, streamlining what is usually a time-consuming research process into a fast, conversational experience.

This Ease the process of searching for the right laptop for hours in media , Our llm is Fine tuned to get the prefect combination of the  laptop.

We have made our AI to go through Only the Reputed Brands (Like ASUS , DELL , MSI , ACER , HP , LENOVO)

College Students Or Even Profesionals Can use this to find the prefect laptop for thier tech stacks.
